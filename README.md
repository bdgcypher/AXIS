# Axis
Axis is a chat application similar to Discord that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. This project uses the GetStream API to handle chat functionality and provide a seamless chat experience for users.

## Usage

This application is created as a fun way for my friends and I to communicate and as a way for me to practice with api calls, React useContext, localStorage, and complex component structures.

## Features

Axis has the following features:

* Real-time chat messaging
* User authentication and authorization
* Direct messaging between users
* Group messaging in channels
* Joining and leaving channels
* Typing indicators and read receipts
* Notification badges for unread messages
* User profiles with avatars
